# Tsinghua Projects
Programs created during my time at Tsinghua Fall '17

## What is this repo?
This repository includes the more challenging coding assignments and projects that I did during my first semester as a CS major in Tsinghua University.

## How does it work?
Each subdirectory refers to a particular assignment or project, which includes the instructions of the program, the input and desired output, as well as the main code itself. Do note: As the entire course was instructed using Chinese, all instructions are written in Chinese. However, code files are written in English.

## What is the goal of this repo?
This repository is meant to help future students or anyone who looks to improve their coding fundementals. Not only does this provide a relatively comprehensive list of intermediate assignments, it also provides sample code to understand implementations of certain algorithms that are widely used today.

## What topics are covered in this course?
Most assignments cover topics such as Recursion, Breadth First Search, and utilizes different data structures includes strings, vectors, queues, maps, etc. 

## Final notes
To all who use this repository, thank you and I hope that you will find it helpful for your learning. Cheers!
